# Weekend Challenge 11 - React-Redux Feedback Form

## Instructions

Reviewing code is an important role developers play. We're going to practice reviewing code from others.

- Get the repo url from your partner
- Get your partner's project running on your computer
- Review the code from your partner and give relevant feedback
- Complete the Markdown section and submit that in the notes section on the assignment app. (Make sure you include who's code you reviewed.)

Practicing compassionate code reviews is important (you can learn more from this video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8EiIPZvh0 )

Notes on General Items
 
I don't have much to say, this code looks awesome!  
I will say that I noticed you opted for the edit instead of back buttons, so the user will have to go through the whole 4 page feedback loop first and then edit.  

Really awesome work
